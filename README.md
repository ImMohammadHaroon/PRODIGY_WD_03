# A simple Tic Tac Toe
My version of tic tac toe is pretty simple. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to choose a move. If you happen to have a friend you can also play with this (on the same pc). To reset the game after completing a match, just click the board.

This graphic show's off the algorithm pretty well. The only difference between this and my own is that I also evaluate the how fast the AI wins, so the AI will make the moves that ensure a speedy victory.

# Wanna help me out?
Like I said this project was build to help me learn javascript. So, if you already know javascript, then help me out!. I am stupid, so this project has a ton of mistakes, or things that are considered "poor practice". If you see something like this, please tell me! I haven't used github much, but I'd think that would fit in the "Issues" tab. Thanks!

# The Future
Well I wanted to add an AI and I did (more about that above). The only thing this implementation is missing is multiplayer. I doubt I will ever add multiplayer to this example because I don't have anywhere to host the server.
